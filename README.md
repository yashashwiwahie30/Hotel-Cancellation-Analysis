Business Problem
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel now deals with several issues, including less revenue and less-than-ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal to increase their efficiency in generating income and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
The main topics of this report are the analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation.

Assumptions
1. No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 will substantially impact the data used.
2. The information is still current and can be used to efficiently analyze a hotel's possible plans.
3. no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique.
4. The hotels need to start using the suggested solutions.
5. The most significant factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.
6. Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.
7. Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations.

Research Question
1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can we make hotel reservation cancellations better?
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?


Hypothesis
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. Customers tend to cancel more frequently When there is a longer waiting list.
3. Most clients come from offline travel agents to make their reservations.

The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of canceled reservations and those that are not. There are still a significant number of reservations that still need to be canceled. 37% of clients canceled their reservations, significantly impacting the hotelâ€™s earnings.


In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. Resort hotels may be more expensive than those in cities.

The line graph above shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. Weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations were the most extensive in August. At the same time, January has the most canceled reservations.

This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are most excellent and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation.

Now, let's see which country has the highest reservation canceled. The top country is Portugal, which has the highest number of cancellations.

Let's check the area from where guests are visiting the hotels and making reservations.
Is it coming from Direct or Groups, Online or Offline Travel Agents? Around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

The graph shows reservations are canceled when the average daily rate is higher than when they are not canceled. The above analysis shows that a higher price leads to higher cancellations.

Suggestions

1.	Cancellation rates rise as the price does. To prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also offer discounts to consumers.
2.	The ratio of cancellations and no cancellations of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than in the city hotels. The hotels should reasonably discount the room prices on weekends or holidays.
3.	In January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue, as the cancellation is the highest this month.
4.	They can also increase the quality of their hotels and services, mainly in Portugal, to reduce the cancellation rate.
